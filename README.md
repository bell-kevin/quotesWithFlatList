# Star Wars Quotes using FlatList

Be sure to read the Canvas page "FlatList Introduction", located just before this project.

For this project, you will display several Star Wars quotes using a FlatList with a separator between each item. The quotes are in this file Download this file.

The screen displays a header "Quotes from Star Wars", then the quotes below it, displayed in a FlatList with a separator line, so the screen can be moved up or down to see the rest of the quotes.

Add background color to the screen (your choice, make sure the text is visible). Increase the font size to 20 for the list items to take up a little more space on the screen and font size of 24 for the header.

Take 2 screenshots as shown above.

Submission: Zip together the root folder and the 2 screenshots, and submit the single zipped folder.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
